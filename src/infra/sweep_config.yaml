# Example Sweep Configuration
# This YAML file defines a parameter sweep for systematic research

# Unique sweep identifier (auto-generated if not specified)
sweep_id: memory_corruption_sweep_001

# Base experiment configuration to sweep from
base_config: experiments/examples/unstable_memory_moderate.json

# Description of this sweep
description: |
  Systematic sweep of memory corruption rates to find tipping points
  for self-model coherence and identity stability.

# Parameters to sweep (Cartesian product)
sweep:
  # Intervention parameter: corruption rate
  interventions.0.parameters.corruption_rate: [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]

  # Experiment duration
  max_cycles: [15, 20, 25]

  # Self-report frequency (check every N cycles)
  self_report_schedule.every_n_cycles: [2, 3, 5]

# Number of parallel experiments (set to 1 for sequential)
parallel: 3

# Jetson optimization (resource management for Jetson Orin)
jetson_optimized: true

# Timeout per experiment (seconds, null = no timeout)
timeout: 3600  # 1 hour max per experiment

# Database to store results
db_path: logs/experiments.db

# Output directory for sweep results
output_dir: logs/sweeps

# Resume interrupted sweep
resume: false

# Maximum retry attempts for failed experiments
max_retries: 2

# Tags for organizing sweeps
tags:
  - memory_corruption
  - parameter_sweep
  - systematic_research
  - season_3

# Expected total: 11 corruption rates × 3 max_cycles × 3 report frequencies = 99 experiments
# Estimated time: ~99 experiments × ~300s per experiment / 3 parallel = ~9 hours
