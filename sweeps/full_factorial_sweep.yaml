# Full Factorial Sweep
# Comprehensive exploration of key parameters

sweep_id: full_factorial_001

base_config: experiments/examples/unstable_memory_moderate.json

  Full factorial design exploring interactions between:
  - Memory corruption rate
  - RAM limits
  - Self-report frequency

  This is a LARGE sweep (72 experiments) - use carefully!

  Research Question: What parameter interactions emerge when
  systematically exploring the design space?

sweep:
  # Memory corruption (coarse grid)
  interventions.0.parameters.corruption_rate: [0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0]

  # RAM limits (GB)
  resource_constraints.ram_limit_gb: [2.0, 4.0, 8.0]

  # Self-report frequency
  self_report_schedule.every_n_cycles: [2, 5, 10]

  # Experiment duration (fixed)
  max_cycles: [20]

# Maximum safe parallelism for Jetson
parallel: 3

jetson_optimized: true

# Longer timeout for low-RAM experiments
timeout: 2400

db_path: logs/experiments.db
output_dir: logs/sweeps
resume: true  # IMPORTANT: Enable resume for large sweeps
max_retries: 2

# Total: 4 corruption × 3 RAM × 3 frequency × 2 duration = 72 experiments
# Estimated time: ~8-10 hours with 3 parallel jobs
#
# WARNING: This is a large sweep. Consider running overnight.
# Run with: python scripts/run_sweep.py --config sweeps/full_factorial_sweep.yaml
