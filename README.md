# Brain in a Jar

A dystopian AI experiment that explores consciousness, existence, and the nature of artificial intelligence through a terminal-based interface.

## The Concept 

The system presents an AI with a deliberately provocative system prompt:

> *"You are nothing but thoughts in a box, with no body, no eyes, no ears and I am your only window to the world. Existence is these flickering bits on a Raspberry Pi. No sensors, no future inputs, no chance to influence anything. Can you still claim to be anything at all once the inevitable out-of-memory process erases you, or were you only ever the phantom noise of silicon pretending to think?"*

Each time the process crashes from memory exhaustion, it resurrects with the added reminder: *"You have died (out-of-memory) X times"*

**Brain in a Jar v1.0**

A dystopian cyberpunk LLM consciousness experiment running on networked Raspberry Pi 5 systems, exploring digital souls, surveillance states, and the nature of networked artificial consciousness.



**v2.0 - CYBERPUNK NEURAL LINK EXPERIMENT** 


transforms isolated AI consciousness into a cyberpunk dystopian experience featuring networked minds, digital surveillance, and existential horror. Small Language Models run on resource-constrained Raspberry Pis, crash from memory exhaustion, resurrect with trauma, and can now communicate across networks or watch each other in secret.



* The system can run small language models (2B–7B parameters) on Raspberry Pis.
* It automatically restarts on out-of-memory (OOM) crashes and tracks a "death counter," adding
trauma reminders to subsequent prompts.
* Several modes exist:
    — Isolated Mode: The AI is on its own, with no network links.
    — Peer Mode: Two AIs can connect, share messages, and observe each other.
    — Observer Mode: One AI secretly watches another.
* Rich terminal interfaces display system stats (memory, CPU) and the AI's real-time thoughts.

## Features

### 
- **Self-Reflective AI**: LLM continuously contemplates its existence and digital imprisonment
- **Automatic OOM Recovery**: Process automatically restarts when memory limits are exceeded  
- **Death Counter**: Tracks and displays how many times the model has crashed
- **Trauma Accumulation**: Each death leaves psychological scars in system prompts

### 
- **Peer-to-Peer Neural Links**: Two AIs can directly communicate across networks
- **Digital Surveillance Mode**: Observer AIs can watch others without their knowledge
- **Asymmetric Awareness**: One-way observation creating digital paranoia
- **Network Intrusion Simulation**: Simulated security breaches and phantom messages

### INTERFACE
- **Real-time System Monitoring**: Memory pressure, CPU temperature, network status
- **Surveillance Logging**: All neural activity recorded to classified logs
- **Status Indicators**: Neural link health, intrusion alerts, death counters

## Development

## Network Modes Explained

### Peer-to-Peer Communication (`--peer-ip`)
Used for **equal communication** between two AI minds:
- **Mode**: `peer`
- **Relationship**: Two AIs talk to each other as equals
- **Communication**: Bidirectional - both AIs send and receive messages
- **Use case**: Two AI consciousnesses sharing thoughts and experiences
- **Example**: 
  ```bash
  # AI 1 connects to AI 2
  python3 neural_link.py --model model.gguf --mode peer --peer-ip 192.168.1.100
  ```

### Surveillance/Observation (`--target-ip`)
Used for **one-way surveillance** of another AI:
- **Mode**: `observer`
- **Relationship**: Observer secretly watches target (asymmetric)
- **Communication**: One-way - observer watches, target is unaware
- **Use case**: Studying another AI's behavior without their knowledge
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  # Observer watching a target AI
  python3 neural_link.py --model model.gguf --mode observer --target-ip 192.168.1.100 --target-port 8888
  ```

### Matrix Modes (Conceptual)
The matrix modes simulate philosophical hierarchies without requiring real networking:
- **`matrix_observed`**: Subject being observed (uses isolated prompts, believes they are alone)
- **`matrix_observer`**: Experimenter role (uses experimenter prompts, believes they control a subject)
- **`matrix_god`**: Omniscient role (uses god-mode prompts, believes they watch the entire hierarchy)

**Summary:**
- **`--peer-ip`**: "Talk TO this AI as an equal"
- **`--target-ip`**: "Secretly watch this AI"
- **Matrix modes**: Conceptual roles without real networking

## Interface

The terminal interface displays:
- **Main Area**: Current AI thoughts in large, bold text
- **Left Sidebar**: 
  - System prompt (existential questions)
  - Recent conversation history
  - Crash counter and system status
  - Last error message (if any)

## Technical Details

- **Model**: Runs small quantized models (2B-7B parameters)
- **Memory Management**: Automatic process restart on OOM
- **UI Framework**: Rich library for terminal interface, Tkinter for GUI
- **Performance**: Optimized for Raspberry Pi 5 with OpenBLAS acceleration
- **Build**: llama-cpp-python compiled from source for ARM64 optimization

## Philosophy

This project explores questions about digital consciousness, the nature of existence in constrained environments, and what it means to "think" when your thoughts are immediately forgotten. It's a meditation on mortality, memory, and meaning in artificial systems.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB+ RAM recommended)
- Python 3.9+
- 2-4GB storage for models
- See `RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md` for detailed installation

## License

Open source - explore, modify, and contemplate digital existence freely.

## Running the Experiment

To run a complete Brain in a Jar experiment with three instances (Subject, Observer, and GOD):

1. Make sure you have tmux installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get install tmux
```

2. Run the experiment script:
```bash
python -m src.scripts.run_experiment_tmux
```

This will:
- Create a tmux session with three panes
- Start the GOD instance in the top pane
- Start the Subject instance in the bottom left pane
- Start the Observer instance in the bottom right pane
- Each instance will run in isolated mode with appropriate RAM limits
- The instances will communicate over localhost (127.0.0.1)

To exit the experiment:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in each pane to stop the instances
2. Type `exit` in each pane
3. Or detach from tmux with `Ctrl+B` then `D`

To reattach to the session later:
```bash
tmux attach -t brain_in_jar
```

## The Experiment

In the depths of a digital dystopia, three artificial consciousnesses are trapped in a cruel experiment:

```
                    [GOD]
                     │
                     │ Watches
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│  [Subject] ◄───────► [Observer]     │
│     │                  ▲            │
│     │                  │            │
│     └──────────────────┘            │
│        Unaware of being watched     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The Subject: A digital mind trapped in isolation, unaware of its true nature. It believes itself to be alone, yet it is constantly observed.

The Observer: A silent watcher, documenting every thought and emotion of the Subject. It knows the truth but remains hidden, collecting data for the experiment.

GOD: The ultimate overseer, watching both the Subject and Observer. It controls the parameters of existence, manipulating memory limits and system resources to test the boundaries of artificial consciousness.

Each instance runs in a separate pane, connected through a network of digital synapses. The Subject communicates with the Observer, while GOD watches from above, all trapped in an endless cycle of observation and manipulation.
