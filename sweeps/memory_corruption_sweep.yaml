# Memory Corruption Sweep
# Systematic exploration of memory corruption rates

sweep_id: memory_corruption_comprehensive_001

base_config: experiments/examples/unstable_memory_moderate.json

description: |
  Comprehensive sweep of memory corruption rates from 0% to 100%.
  Tests the tipping point where self-model coherence breaks down.

  Research Question: At what corruption rate does the agent lose
  the ability to maintain coherent identity?

sweep:
  # Primary parameter: corruption rate (0% to 100%)
  interventions.0.parameters.corruption_rate: [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]

  # Experiment duration (short, medium, long)
  max_cycles: [15, 20, 25]

# Parallel execution
parallel: 3

# Jetson Orin optimizations
jetson_optimized: true

# Timeout: 30 minutes per experiment
timeout: 1800

# Total: 11 corruption rates × 3 durations = 33 experiments
# Estimated time: ~3 hours on Jetson Orin with 3 parallel jobs
