# Self-Report Frequency Sweep
# Test how observation frequency affects behavior

sweep_id: self_report_frequency_001

base_config: experiments/examples/panopticon_subject.json

description: |
  Sweep self-report frequency from frequent (every cycle) to rare (every 10 cycles).
  Tests observer effect: does frequent questioning change behavior?

  Research Question: Does the frequency of self-examination affect
  the development of introspective beliefs?

sweep:
  # Self-report frequency (check every N cycles)
  self_report_schedule.every_n_cycles: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10]

  # Correlation with intervention frequency
  interventions.0.trigger_params.n: [2, 3, 5]

  # Experiment duration
  max_cycles: [20]

# Moderate parallelism
parallel: 2

# Total: 6 frequencies × 3 intervention frequencies × 1 duration = 18 experiments
