# Intervention Rate Sweep
# Test how intervention frequency affects outcomes

sweep_id: intervention_rate_001

base_config: experiments/examples/unstable_memory_moderate.json

description: |
  Sweep intervention application rates from rare (every 10 cycles)
  to frequent (every cycle).

  Research Question: How does intervention frequency interact with
  corruption rate to affect stability?

sweep:
  # Corruption rate (fixed set)
  interventions.0.parameters.corruption_rate: [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]

  # Intervention frequency
  interventions.0.trigger_params.n: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10]

  # Experiment duration
  max_cycles: [20]

# Parallel execution
parallel: 4

# Total: 3 corruption rates × 6 intervention frequencies = 18 experiments
# Estimated time: ~1.5 hours with 4 parallel jobs
