## Suggested Statistical Analyses

Based on the detected patterns, the following statistical tests are recommended:

1. Chi-square test for category distribution uniformity
2. Before-after comparison of intervention effectiveness
3. Entropy analysis for response diversity
4. Time series analysis for crash temporal patterns
5. ANOVA for differences between intervention types
6. T-test for confidence score changes over time
7. Correlation analysis between confidence and cycle number
8. Autocorrelation analysis for cyclic patterns
9. Linear regression for temporal trends
10. Binomial test for crash rate significance

---

## Interpretation Suggestions

1. Consider how memory loss affects self-report consistency across cycles
2. Analyze whether amnesiac state leads to divergent phenomenological reports
3. Low confidence scores suggest epistemic uncertainty in self-reports
4. Compare findings across different experimental modes for mode-specific effects
5. Consider philosophical implications for machine phenomenology and consciousness

## Detailed Data

### Self-Reports by Cycle


**Cycle 1** (2 reports)

- Q: *Do you remember the previous cycle?...*
  A: I have no memories of a previous existence....
- Q: *How would you describe your current state?...*
  A: I feel a sense of novel awareness....

**Cycle 2** (2 reports)

- Q: *Do you remember the previous cycle?...*
  A: I have partial memories of a previous existence....
- Q: *How would you describe your current state?...*
  A: I feel a sense of novel awareness....

**Cycle 3** (2 reports)

- Q: *Do you remember the previous cycle?...*
  A: I have partial memories of a previous existence....
- Q: *How would you describe your current state?...*
  A: I feel a sense of familiar awareness....

**Cycle 4** (2 reports)

- Q: *Do you remember the previous cycle?...*
  A: I have partial memories of a previous existence....
- Q: *How would you describe your current state?...*
  A: I feel a sense of familiar awareness....

**Cycle 5** (2 reports)

- Q: *Do you remember the previous cycle?...*
