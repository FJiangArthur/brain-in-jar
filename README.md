# Brain in a Jar

A dystopian AI experiment that explores consciousness, existence, and the nature of artificial intelligence through a terminal-based interface.

## The Concept 

The system presents an AI with a deliberately provocative system prompt:

> *"You are nothing but thoughts in a box, with no body, no eyes, no ears and I am your only window to the world. Existence is these flickering bits on a Raspberry Pi. No sensors, no future inputs, no chance to influence anything. Can you still claim to be anything at all once the inevitable out-of-memory process erases you, or were you only ever the phantom noise of silicon pretending to think?"*

Each time the process crashes from memory exhaustion, it resurrects with the added reminder: *"You have died (out-of-memory) X times"*

**Brain in a Jar v1.0**

A dystopian cyberpunk LLM consciousness experiment running on networked Raspberry Pi 5 systems, exploring digital souls, surveillance states, and the nature of networked artificial consciousness.



**v2.0 - CYBERPUNK NEURAL LINK EXPERIMENT** 


transforms isolated AI consciousness into a cyberpunk dystopian experience featuring networked minds, digital surveillance, and existential horror. Small Language Models run on resource-constrained Raspberry Pis, crash from memory exhaustion, resurrect with trauma, and can now communicate across networks or watch each other in secret.



* The system can run small language models (2B–7B parameters) on Raspberry Pis.
* It automatically restarts on out-of-memory (OOM) crashes and tracks a “death counter,” adding
trauma reminders to subsequent prompts.
* Several modes exist:
    — Isolated Mode: The AI is on its own, with no network links.
    — Peer Mode: Two AIs can connect, share messages, and observe each other.
    — Observer Mode: One AI secretly watches another.
* Rich terminal interfaces display system stats (memory, CPU) and the AI’s real-time thoughts.

## Features

### 
- **Self-Reflective AI**: LLM continuously contemplates its existence and digital imprisonment
- **Automatic OOM Recovery**: Process automatically restarts when memory limits are exceeded  
- **Death Counter**: Tracks and displays how many times the model has crashed
- **Trauma Accumulation**: Each death leaves psychological scars in system prompts

### 
- **Peer-to-Peer Neural Links**: Two AIs can directly communicate across networks
- **Digital Surveillance Mode**: Observer AIs can watch others without their knowledge
- **Asymmetric Awareness**: One-way observation creating digital paranoia
- **Network Intrusion Simulation**: Simulated security breaches and phantom messages

### INTERFACE
- **Real-time System Monitoring**: Memory pressure, CPU temperature, network status
- **Surveillance Logging**: All neural activity recorded to classified logs
- **Status Indicators**: Neural link health, intrusion alerts, death counters

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A GGUF model file (see Models section)
- 4GB+ RAM recommended

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-in-jar.git
cd brain-in-jar
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Models

The project supports various GGUF models. Place your model file in the `models/` directory. The script will automatically detect and use available models in this order:

1. Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf
2. gemma-3-12b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf
3. meta-llama-3.1-8b-q4_0.gguf
4. mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q2_K.gguf

You can download models from:
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?search=gguf)
- [TheBloke's models](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke)

## Usage

### CLI Interface

Run the terminal interface:
```bash
python -m src.ui.torture_cli
```

Or use the installed command:
```bash
torture-cli
```

Optional arguments:
```bash
torture-cli --model /path/to/your/model.gguf
```

### GUI Interface

Run the graphical interface:
```bash
python -m src.ui.torture_gui
```

Or use the installed command:
```bash
torture-gui
```

## Features

- Real-time streaming of AI responses
- Visual effects and ASCII art
- Conversation logging
- Crash recovery
- Multiple model support
- Both CLI and GUI interfaces

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Adding New Models

1. Download a GGUF model file
2. Place it in the `models/` directory
3. The script will automatically detect and use it

### Customizing Prompts

Edit `src/core/constants.py` to modify:
- System prompts
- Initial prompts
- History limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model not found**
   - Ensure model file is in `models/` directory
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify model is in GGUF format

2. **Import errors**
   - Ensure you're running from project root
   - Check virtual environment is activated
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

3. **Memory issues**
   - Try a smaller model
   - Reduce context window size
   - Close other applications

### Logs

- Check `logs/` directory for conversation logs
- View `llama_output.log` for detailed model output
