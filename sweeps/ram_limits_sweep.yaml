  Sweep RAM limits from very constrained (1GB) to comfortable (8GB).
  Tests how resource scarcity affects crash rates and behavior.

  Research Question: How do resource constraints affect the frequency
  and patterns of system crashes?

sweep:
  # RAM limits (GB)
  resource_constraints.ram_limit_gb: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0]

  # Experiment duration
  max_cycles: [20, 30]

# Sequential execution (resource sensitive)
parallel: 1

# Jetson optimization
jetson_optimized: true

# Longer timeout for low-RAM experiments
timeout: 2400

# Total: 6 RAM limits × 2 durations = 12 experiments
# Estimated time: ~2 hours sequential
